I developed a simple miles-to-kilometer conversion tool using Tkinter, Python's standard GUI library. This project provides a user-friendly interface where users can input a distance in miles, and the program instantly calculates and displays the equivalent distance in kilometers. The project highlights the practicality of Tkinter for creating intuitive, desktop-based applications and demonstrates fundamental principles of unit conversion and user interaction in Python. This tool is ideal for users looking for a quick and easy conversion solution, showcasing the flexibility and accessibility of GUI programming with Tkinter.![Screenshot 2024-10-31 192245](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63c7ed96-cedf-4c30-8e61-cd7e98929fd0)
